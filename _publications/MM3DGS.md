excerpt:
    "<center><img src='/images/MM3DGS.gif'></center><br/> Our method, MM3DGS,
    addresses the limitations of prior neural radiance field-based
    representations by enabling faster rendering, scale awareness, and improved
    trajectory tracking. Our framework enables keyframe-based mapping and
    tracking utilizing loss functions that incorporate relative pose
    transformations from pre-integrated inertial measurements, depth estimates,
    and measures of photometric rendering quality. Experimental evaluation on
    several scenes shows a 3x improvement in tracking and 5% improvement in
    photometric rendering quality compared to the current 3DGS SLAM
    state-of-the-art, while allowing real-time rendering."
