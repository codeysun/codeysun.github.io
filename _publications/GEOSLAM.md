excerpt:
    "<center><img src='/images/geoslam.png'></center><br/> This paper presents a
    novel headset tracking frame-work designed for extended reality (XR)
    applications. By loosely coupling a visual simultaneous localization and
    mapping (SLAM) algorithm to a tightly-coupled carrier phase differential
    GNSS (CDGNSS) and inertial sensor subsystem, the proposed system aims to
    achieve centimeter-accurate, globally-referenced tracking that persists
    during extended periods of GNSS degradation. Collaborative and persistent XR
    experiences are enabled through accurate map creation utilizing a bundle
    adjustment approach for map generation and maintenance. Cloud or near-edge
    offloading of computationally demanding steps in the pipeline is explored to
    reduce the computational demand on the headset. This paper also explores the
    benefit of additional headset tracking constraints offered by
    direction-of-arrival measurements to nearby cellular base stations."
