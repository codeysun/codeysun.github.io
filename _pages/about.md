I am currently an M.S. Electrical Engineering student at Stanford. Prior, I
received my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of
Texas at Austin. I have a deep interest in AR/VR and robotics research. During
my time at UT, I was advised by Professors
[ Todd E. Humphreys ](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/humphreys)
and [ Atlas Wang ](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/atlas-wang) as part
of the [ Radionavigation Lab ](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/) and
[ VITA Research Group ](https://vita-group.github.io/).
